    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">FlyUX is an airlne website that I created while completing my UX Professional Diploma from UX Design Institute and Glasgow Caledonian University (2020-2021). The project was to research and design a new airline website, focusing on the flight booking process up until payment.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center; color: #282828;">Affinity Diagram</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">Using data gathered from competitive benchmarking, surveys and usability tests, I led an affinity mapping session to identify categories and patterns in the flight booking process. By combining observations from multiple users, we are able to pull from a richer data set, and thus find richer insights. The most interesting thing I discovered during this process is how pain points can sometimes be literally visualized as larger categories in the affinity diagram. This is especially valuable to identify this early on in the UX Design process.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center; color: #282828;">Customer Journey Map</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">Using categories identified in the Affinity Mapping exercise, this document visualizes steps needing refinement/pain points in the flight booking process. While the overall experience measures aren't an exact science, this concise document can be useful to communicate to stakeholders which painpoints the new designs will seek to improve.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center; color: #282828;">User Flow Diagram</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">Using the Customer Journey Map as a guide, this document follows one common use case and helps pin down the steps and wireframes needed to complete the flight booking process. The paradox of specificity states that adapting efforts to a specific audience actually addresses a much broader set of needs. Applying this paradox, the focus on one use case at this step in the design process actually leads to a more universal solution.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center; color: #282828;">Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">In order to quickly and cost-effectively iterate ideas for input before finalizing designs, I started the wireframing process with low fidelity hand-drawn sketches. By starting with these brief sketches, time and money is saved as feedback from stakeholders can be gathered before spending much longer on refinement.</p>
    <img class="image2" style="width: 80%; height: auto; margin-left: 10%;" src="images/flyux_images/low_fi_wireframes.png"><br><br>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center; color: #282828;">High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
     <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">Below is a subset of the final high fidelity wireframes that would be handed off to Software Engineers along with design specifications. As I identified during the research and analysis portion of the UX design process, a major pain point present with many competitors was confusion about the differences between pricing options. For many users, having to constantly weigh the price versus pricing level benefits was very time consuming. By clearly laying out the different pricing options early on rather than making the user look for it in the fine print, the FlyUX experience seeks to simplify price selection as much as possible.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">I created a set of final documents to hand off to Software Engineers for implementation to begin, and below are some examples.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; text-align: center; color: #282828;">Final Takeaways</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">While I have previously applied bits and pieces of the UX Design process to previous projects, this was my first time running through the full UX Design process from start to finish. This was a fruitful learning experience that taught me to challenge my assumptions by starting with thorough research before diving into the design process. Getting to observe users interact with software provides such rich insights and taught me to be more empathetic when designing for all user types. By seeking out a wide variety of perspectives early on, the end software product is likely to be much more accessible and therefore more usable.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">I also learned that UX designers don't always need to 'redesign the wheel.' There are conventions in UX Design that exist for a reason&mdash;they match users' mental models and have very high learnability. Whereas I previously felt immense pressure to create something outside the box that's never been done before, I now understand that it is a more nuanced process. UX Designers piece together new and existing visual elements to create a user experience that is as frictionless as possible.</p>
